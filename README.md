# catarion_rest 
The RESTful API can be used for managing data in customer relationship management systems. It includes authentication functionality for both Users and Admin Roles, and works with relational db (MySQL). The API also exposes a set of endpoints that represents CRUD operations:

  **C** reate a User  
  **R** ead a list of Users / Read a personal information about a User  
  **U** pdate User's information  
  **D** elete a User
  

    The RESTful API defines:
     - 5 endpoints specification (URL)
     - HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that a client uses to interact with the server and perform operations on resources
     - data format (JSON)

## What I learned

#### BACKEND
  
🧩 Implemented an API. Learned about idempotent HTTP methods (GET, PUT, ~~DELETE~~) and that a well-designed server should be idempotent!

🧩 Tested endpoints in **Postman API**: specified the endpoint URLs, along with headers, parameters, and body content to create a request and get response.

🧩 Experienced with Relational Database **MySQL**. Built relations between entities (Many-To-Many). Practiced lazy loading. Designed DTO object to solve N+1 query problem in ORM. Also I used Join Fetch to join 2 database tables (user & role) within the query and initialize the association on the returned entity. 

🧩 Provided Authentication using **Spring Security** and provided Admin Panel and User Panel. 

🧩 Explored **Jackson library** for JSON processing in Java (convert POJO objects to / from JSON).

🧩 Incorporated Spring REST Client - **RestTemplate**, as a primary tool for converting an object into a http-request and http-response into an object. Next project I plan to switch to an alternative HTTP client WebClient (that provides both synchronous and asynchronous approaches - no need to wait for http-response) as RestTemplate becomes depricated since Spring 5. In microservices - Feign Client (Spring Cloud).
  
#### FRONTEND
  
🧩 Designed the front end of the web app. Used **HTML** (page structure), **CSS** (style information)

🧩 **JavaScript** (behavior control of different elements) adding **jQuery** (load() Method) and  **Bootstrap** (grid system) to simplify JavaScript coding. Learned about asynchronous method that runs separately from the main thread.

## Screenshots 

#### DTO implementation in order to:
- deliver only the rerqiered data (instead of transferring the complete object)
- reflect what data is being transmitted
- reduction of connectivity between parts of code (client - server / service - controller)


#### Admin Panel 
 - CRUD methods
 - Users List
 - at url: http:/catarion/rest/admin/

#### User Panel
 - User's information

#### Security Features
 - loginSuccessHandler - for logistic of successful authentication
 - passwordEncoder
